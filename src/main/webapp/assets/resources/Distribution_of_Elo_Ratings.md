## Distribution of Elo Ratings ##

{{plot-10}}

As you can see, most records come from tournament games with high Elo Rating.
I underline players with >2000 Elo rating are experts in Chess. With about 5 millions of games listed, we’ll obtain accurate results.
I remember you that the Elo system appears in the 1970’, this is why oldest games don’t appear here.
