			<p>How many unique positions have been played? How many blunders
				chess grand masters, amateurs, or world top players do? For which
				moves mistakes are more prevalent? Was Kasparov better than Fisher
				or Carlsen? All these questions can have an answer thanks to the
				amount of games we have and the impressive skills of chess computer
				engines. Explore and consult insights online (or challenge
				scientists to discover new ones)!</p>
